# 9-Axis-IMU-Tracking
3D position tracking based on data from 9 degree of freedom IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer).

# Data Source
For now, I use an APP called [HyperIMU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ianovir.hyper_imu) to pull data from my phone. Data is sent through TCP to data_receiver.py.
